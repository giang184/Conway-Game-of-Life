### Conway's Game of Life
by _Andrew Giang_

### Work in Progress
I'm currently working on this project during my free time. It's about 90% done. You can simulate the game, but I want to be able to add more features to it like:
* input how many steps you want to simulate
* how fast you want to simulate
* start and stop button
* add some starter lexicons

2. JavaScript/ES2018+
